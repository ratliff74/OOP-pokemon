    "Click on the `Documentation` tab, then click on v2. On the next page you'll see a bunch of words that seemingly make no sense. Just like with any API, there is documentation showing you how to use it. API documentation, by nature, is very wordy, overwhelming and almost never straightforward. You will find very few APIs that have simple documentation. Once you start to become a mid-senior level engineer, the little details in documentation will make all the difference in the quality of your results. Most people find API documentation difficult to navigate at first. Don't worry, it's normal.\n",
